<FONT face="Informal Roman" size="3" color="green"><P>Music is a form of art that uses sound organised in time. Music is also a form of <BR>
entertainment that puts sounds together in a way that people like, find interesting or dance to. Most music<BR>includes people singing with their voices or
<BR>playing musical instruments, such as the piano, guitar, drums or violin.<BR>Music can raise someone's mood, get them excited, or make them calm and relaxed.<BR>
 Music also - and this is important - allows us to feel nearly or possibly all
<BR>emotions that we experience in our lives.</P></FONT>
