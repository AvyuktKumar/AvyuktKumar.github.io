We all knowingly or unknowingly waste water, we waste it as we do not need it next time. 
Water is important for our living source for all types of living beings. The UN(United Nations) has set the limit of minimum 50 litres per 
person per day which means 2 and a half buckets per person per day.</P></FONT>

<FONT Size="5" Color="Blue"><P>The distribution of water over the globe is quite uneven due to a number of factors. Some places have good amount of rain and water-rich. On the other hand,
there are deserts which have scanty rainfall. India is a vast country and the rainfall is not the same everywhere. Some regions have excessive rain while some others have very little 
rainfall. Excessive rains cause floods, whereas the absence of rains results in droughts. Therefore, some regions in our country may have floods while others may suffer from droughts at 
the same time.</P></FONT>
