<FONT Size="5" Color="Blue"><P>Groundwater is water present under ground, the upper most layer of the groundwater is the water table. Below the water table, the water stored between the 
hard layers of rock is called the Aquifer. Water from the aquifer can be pumped using handpumps, tube wells, etc. How is this groundwater rechraged after we draw water from it ?. 
This groundwater is recharged by the process of <B><U>Infilteration</U></B>.Infilteration is the process of water seeping into the ground. 
But, the amount of water is drawn and the rate at which it is replenished by Infilteration is not the same(Process of Infilteration or recharging groundwater takes time, 
it dosen't get recharged easily in one or two days). And if we start continuously drawing water from the water table and if it is not sufficiently replenished, 
it will get depleted.</P></FONT>
