<FONT face="Algerian" size="7" color="White">Painting is the practice of applying paint, pigment, color or other medium to a solid surface.<BR>
 The medium is commonly applied to the base with a brush, but other implements, such as knives, sponges, and airbrushes,<BR>
 can be used. In art, the term painting describes both the act and the result of the action.</FONT>
